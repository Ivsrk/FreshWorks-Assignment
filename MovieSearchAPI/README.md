# MovieWiki Using OMDB API

Build a web application to enable users to search for any movie and view details about it.

Functional requirements:
1. The first page should have a search bar to search for any movie. Use APIs from http://www.omdbapi.com/.
2. On search, it should list the movies that match the search query in a grid form with posters. 
3. On clicking a movie poster, one should be redirected to a movie information page to show details about the movie. This will also contain the full plot. You can be creative in designing this page.
4. The details page should have a link to go back to the previous page, where the search results were displayed thus storing the previous state.
